This is the README. You can run the DocumentReader using java main inputfilename outputfilename. For the toy test file,
I used the provided input and generated the output using java main "input.txt" "output.txt". The real file of kama.txt
and kama3.txt can be similarly generated. The average collision length is again at the end of the output text file. The 
comments on the code should suffice for the rest. :)
