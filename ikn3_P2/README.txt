I used ArrayList as it is overall easier for me to manuver through and I know exactly the size of my arrays. (256 for ASCII)
The main method only compresses and gives you the output file WHICH HAS THE SAVINGS INSIDE. To produce the table, you have
to use the method generateTable which will give you the table. My comments should be good enough for the rest.
