The sorting class has all three of the sorting methods inside it. They all work and are properly commented. The 
reporting1 class just has to be started using java reporting1 (WARNING THIS WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO GENERATE) and 
will deliver the results.txt which contains the mean, median, and variance for all array lengths and for all sorting 
methods. It is extremely long and inefficient for which I am sorry. It does also have the helper methods which 
calculate the variance, mean and median. in reporting 2, just write java reporting2 "filename.txt" and it should run 
and output the three files with sorted arrays as well as generate the system message for the times of the running. 
I'm also attaching my excel data because I don't think I set the seeds right. Everything is also measured in nanoseconds.
